Notes for me

To get code changes onto the phone:
`ionic build` build it
`ionic cap copy` copy the code to the project
`ionic cap sync` don't actually know if this is necessary lol
`ionic cap open android` open it in android studio
Then plug the phone in and pick it from the dropdown next to the run button at the top
Will set up ios sometime soon

Icons go in the ionic project and follow this convention
assets/
├── icon-only.png
├── icon-foreground.png
├── icon-background.png
├── splash.png
└── splash-dark.png
OR
assets/
├── logo.png
└── logo-dark.png
The run this:
`npx capacitor-assets generate`
- side note, `npm install @capacitor/assets --save-dev` won't work in the ion-quez but it works just fine in the parent directory so that's why there's a node_modules folder there. No idea why
