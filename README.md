This is a fake twitter-like app that I use for a D&D 5e campaign I'm running. The setting is modern and the player characters are death row criminals in a hunger games/most dangerous game style televised game show where surviving for 30 days means they're granted freedom. I figured in a modern setting like this there would probably be some kind of forum where people can livetweet about the show as they watch it, so I started working on this fake twitter app where I add posts from people watching the show. Before each session of the campaign, I load the most recent version of the app onto my phone and hand it to the players so they can catch up on what the audience thought of their actions last time we played.
## Future plans
The main point of making this is just an excuse to mess around with Ionic Framework while making something fun and immersive for my players. Some future ideas include:
1. ~~Load the data in from a json array~~ done!
2. ~~Supply that json array from a spring backend~~ done!
3. Make it so clicking an account shows all tweets from that account like you would expect it to
4. Make username and hashtag links actually work
5. Maybe have the spring backend handle the user calls and searches
6. Make a real settings screen with a profanity filter or something
7. Fix the darkmode implementation to help it ignore system settings
8. Make polls real (as in it shows the options, the user picks, then it shows all results)
9. Make it so you can switch the way the poll data is displayed? Like toggle between pie and bar? No need to do it, it would just be neat to see if it's possible
10. Move backend to EC2
11. Move H2 to S3
## Hey
If you're one of my players get out of here lol
